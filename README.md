The approach to this project included the exploring of the raw shopping dataset that we were provided. This step included the use of Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations of our data. From there the data was then transformed to create a clean dataset. This step included checking columns for null values and dropping or replacing them to answer our key questions.
